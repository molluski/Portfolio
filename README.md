# Portfolio
portfolio with filtering gallery.

Kinda works as it should. What is clumsy though is that for the appearing info boxes that pop next to the images, 
I created multiple functions for the exact same function, as all the buttons mess up with each others otherwise.
I'm sure, there's a simple solution but for now I just made it work somehow.
